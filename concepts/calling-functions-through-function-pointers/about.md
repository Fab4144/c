# About

Just as a pointer can be made to an `int` or other basic data type, a pointer can be made to a function.
A function pointer can be used to pass a function to another function.
A function which is passed as a parameter value to another function is known as a first class function.
A function which takes one or more functions as a parameter, or which returns a function, is known as a higher order function.
